the game requires 2 players to play. this game is much like tic-tac-toe, but only bigger and better. There is a 20*20 grid and total
of 5 combinations are to be made to win the game.these can be vertical, horizontal,left-diagnol and right-diagnol.
please note that not all graphics ans music might be able to play correctly as relative paths have been used and they could have been 
mislocated . rest should work
